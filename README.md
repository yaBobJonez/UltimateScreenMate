# Ultimate ScreenMate v1.2-BETA

---

**This project is far from complete!**

It may and probably does contain bugs, use at your own risk.
Currently no binaries are provided, as it's not yet optimized
to work outside of the Godot engine. Tested and developed
solely on Linux, so support for other operating systems may
be incomplete or flawed.

## TODO:
- add mates' names support
- allow disabling certain actions (replace Settings)
- refactor
