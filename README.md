# Ultimate ScreenMate v1.0-BETA

---

**This project is far from complete!**

It may and probably does contain bugs, use at your own risk.
Currently no binaries are provided, as it's not yet optimized
to work outside of the Godot engine. Tested and developed
solely on Linux, so support for other operating systems may
be incomplete of flawed. Does NOT support Godot 4.1+ yet (stay
on 4.0 to avoid errors).

## TODO:
- "movement(s)" category (like "actions" and "random")
- three-phase teleportation support
- use `gettext` files for translation
- fix a bug when buttons stop working after returning from settings in case of errors/warnings
